# ECMA-376 Database Viewer - Working Solution

## Problem
The original Next.js application was failing with console errors due to the "#" character in the directory path `generate-#12`. This caused React Server Components bundling errors and prevented the application from running properly.

## Root Cause
The "#" character in the directory path was being treated as a fragment identifier by Next.js bundler, causing module resolution to fail with errors like:
```
Could not find the module "...path/generate-#12/...file.js#" in the React Client Manifest
```

## Solution
Created a standalone Express.js server (`server.js`) that bypasses the Next.js bundling issues while maintaining all functionality.

## Implementation

### 1. Standalone Server (`server.js`)
- Express.js server serving the HTML interface and API routes
- Direct database connection using PostgreSQL client
- All API endpoints implemented: `/api/health`, `/api/stats`, `/api/sections`
- Proper pagination support with limit/offset parameters

### 2. Database Layer
- Updated database functions to support pagination
- Improved connection pooling for better performance
- Support for search, depth filtering, and pagination

### 3. Frontend Interface
- Complete HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface in `public/index.html`
- Pagination controls with Previous/Next buttons
- Page indicators showing current page and total sections
- Responsive design with professional styling

## Usage

### Start the Server
```bash
npm run server
# or
node server.js
```

### Access the Application
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Database health check
- `GET /api/stats` - Database statistics including depth distribution
- `GET /api/sections` - Get sections with pagination support
  - `?depth=N` - Filter by depth level
  - `?search=query` - Search in titles and descriptions
  - `?limit=N&offset=M` - Pagination parameters

## Features Working
✅ Database connection and health monitoring
✅ Statistics display with depth distribution
✅ Pagination for all depth levels
✅ Search functionality
✅ Responsive user interface
✅ Professional styling
✅ Previous/Next navigation
✅ Page indicators

## Database Statistics
- Total sections: 602
- Level 1: 23 sections (1 page)
- Level 2: 87 sections (2 pages at 50/page)
- Level 3: 99 sections (2 pages at 50/page) 
- Level 4: 344 sections (7 pages at 50/page)
- Level 5: 49 sections (1 page)

## Performance
- All API calls respond in <100ms
- Pagination loads 50 sections per page
- Database connection pooling for efficiency
- Responsive UI updates

## Testing
The solution has been tested with:
- Database connectivity
- All API endpoints
- Pagination functionality for each level
- Search functionality
- Error handling

The application now works without console errors and provides a complete, functional database viewer with pagination as requested.
