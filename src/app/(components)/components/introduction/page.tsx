        <SubHeading>Why Shadcn UI customized components?</SubHeading>
        <p>
          Shadcn UI is a powerful design system offering reusable components and
          utilities to build cohesive designs. However, its many customization
          options can sometimes feel overwhelming. That&apos;s why we created
          this a list of pre-customized components, enabling you to preview,
          copy, and implement them directly.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Shadcn UI Blocks complements Shadcn UI by providing ready-made,
          customizable components that maintain the flexibility of Shadcn
          UI&apos;s design system while extending its possibilities.
