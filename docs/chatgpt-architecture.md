Great, I’ll analyze the website architectures of Slidesgo, Canva, and SlideModel to identify common and effective patterns in both frontend and backend design, particularly as they relate to building a SaaS-based template marketplace with user authentication and upload/download functionality.

I’ll then synthesize those findings into a recommended architecture using Next.js, shadcn, and Supabase. I’ll let you know when it’s ready.


# Common Patterns in Template Marketplaces

* **Categories & Navigation:** All three sites organize templates by categories or tags (e.g. Business, Technology, Architecture) shown in the header or sidebar.  Slidesgo and SlideModel use multi-level filters (industry, style, color, etc.) on category pages.  Canva likewise presents a browsing UI organized by themes and search (though heavily JavaScript-driven). Trend sections (e.g. “Trending searches” on Slidesgo and SlideModel) surface popular tags.  These patterns suggest a UI with a top nav (home, browse, pricing, login) and a filterable sidebar or header dropdowns.

* **Homepage & Landing Pages:** Slidesgo’s homepage features hero text and trending categories (Disney, Editor’s Choice, etc.) as clickable tiles.  SlideModel’s homepage similarly shows featured template cards in a grid.  Both have clear CTAs: e.g. “Get Started” or “Subscribe” buttons.  Common elements include a prominent header (logo, search/nav menu, login) and sections for featured/new/most-popular templates.

* **Template Listings:** Category pages list templates in a **card grid**.  Each card shows a preview image, title, and tagline.  Filters (checkboxes or tabs) let users refine results by tags (Slidesgo: style, format, subject; SlideModel: tag categories at top like “Software Architecture”).  Pagination or “load more” appears at bottom (Slidesgo: “Next page” link; SlideModel: numbered pages).  This suggests a route structure like `/templates`, `/templates/category/[slug]`, with query parameters for filters (e.g. `/templates?style=minimalist&format=16:9`).  Rendering is server-driven (static or SSR) to support SEO and direct links.

* **Search/Trending:** Instead of a classic search bar, Slidesgo and SlideModel heavily use *predefined* trending queries and tag pages. Slidesgo lists “Trending searches” (e.g. “Disney – 1179 templates”) as links. SlideModel’s “Search” page is actually a tag archive (“search”) with featured items. A SaaS platform should support full-text search, but also highlight common tags (as links) and autocomplete for templates.

* **Template Detail & Downloads:** Clicking a template shows a detail page with preview slides and description. For example, Slidesgo’s detail page for “Construction Project Proposal” shows multiple slide thumbnails【36†】, the title, and download buttons.  Download options (Google Slides, PPT, Canva) are shown, but **gated by account status**.  Slidesgo requires login to download and limits unregistered users to 0 or 3 free downloads/month. Premium templates are marked with a lock/badge, prompting upgrade. Similarly, SlideModel’s detail page forbids download without login (“You must be logged in to download this file”) and displays a “Subscribe Now” CTA. Both UIs encourage sign-up and upsell subscription on the detail page.  This implies routes like `/template/[id]` with client-side checks for login, and overlays or redirect to login/paywall.

* **Authentication & Accounts:** All three platforms have user accounts. Slidesgo offers free accounts (3 downloads/mo) and Premium subscriptions. SlideModel has free accounts and various paid plans (monthly, annual, team) with different download allowances. Login/register flows appear in the header, and account pages show subscription status and download history.  When not logged in, download buttons trigger login prompts. Password resets and social login (Google/Facebook) are handled via FAQ instructions. An admin panel likely exists (not public) for managing templates and subscriptions. These patterns imply backend auth (JWT/session) and role-based DB records (users, subscription level, teams).

* **Subscription & Paywall:** Both Slidesgo and SlideModel implement paywalls. Slidesgo uses Stripe and PayPal for payments and enforces subscription features (unlimited downloads, team seats). SlideModel lists plans on a “Plans & Pricing” page and shows “Subscribe Now” prompts on content pages. Key features include download limits, seat management, and auto-renewal. A new platform should integrate a payment API (e.g. Stripe), store subscription records, and conditionally unlock content. Data models needed include *Subscriptions*, *Payments*, *Licenses*, and possibly *Teams* or *Organizations*.

* **Dashboards & Admin:** Slidesgo’s FAQs mention managing subscriptions and licenses, implying an account dashboard for billing. SlideModel’s logged-in “My Account” page lists downloads and purchase history. Admin UIs would manage templates (CRUD), categories, users and content (not visible publicly). We infer a need for an admin interface to upload new templates, approve user contributions, and review metrics.

* **Search/Filtering Systems:** Slidesgo’s category pages show complex multi-criteria filters (industry, content type, style, subject, format), suggesting a relational data model (templates with tag/category associations). SlideModel uses tag/category filters at top and in related templates section. We should implement a similar faceted search: e.g. tables for *Categories*, *Tags*, *Styles*, and a many-to-many link to *Templates*. Elasticsearch or Supabase full-text indexes could support search queries across title/description/tags.

* **Download Management:** Both sites log downloads per user. Slidesgo explicitly counts monthly limits. The new platform should record each download (with timestamp, user, template ID) for quota enforcement and analytics. Multi-format downloads (PPT, Google Slides, Canva) suggest storing multiple file URLs per template. For private templates (user-uploaded), access control should check owner or shared permissions.

* **UI/UX Patterns:** Consistent design elements include card grids, clear typography, and bright CTAs. For example, Slidesgo’s filter panel uses checkboxes and toggles, and SlideModel’s plans use tabbed pricing tables. Good patterns to borrow: sticky filter sidebar, intuitive pagination or “load more,” and mobile-responsive grid layouts. Use icons/badges for “Premium” and “Favorite.” Both sites encourage “favorite” or “collection” features (Slidesgo “save templates as favorites”, SlideModel “Add to Collection”).

# Proposed Architecture (Next.js + shadcn + Supabase)

## Frontend Structure

* **Framework & Rendering:** Build with Next.js (App Router or Pages Router) using React components. Use **shadcn/ui** (Tailwind CSS + Radix) for UI primitives. Key routes:

  * `/` – Home page (SSR/ISR) with hero, featured collections, trending tags.
  * `/templates` – Templates browse page (with optional query filters).
  * `/templates/category/[categorySlug]` – Category listing (pre-render via SSG + ISR).
  * `/templates/[templateId]` – Template detail page (SSG for public data; client-side check for auth).
  * `/search` – (optional) search results (CSR or SSR for SEO).
  * `/login`, `/register`, `/account/*` – Auth pages (CSR/SSR).
  * `/dashboard` – User dashboard (SSR with auth).
  * `/pricing` – Pricing plans page (SSG).
  * `/upload` – Template upload (protected).
  * `/admin` – (optional) Admin panel for managing content (SSR or static app with role-check).
* **Folder Structure (app or pages):**

  ```
  /components
    /Layout (Navbar, Footer)
    /TemplateCard, /TemplateGrid, /FilterSidebar
    /AuthForm (Login, Register)
    /PricingTable, /SubscriptionForm
    /Dashboard components (Profile, Downloads, Team)
  /app (or /pages)
    /page.tsx (Home)
    /search/page.tsx
    /pricing/page.tsx
    /templates/
      /page.tsx (browse, uses filters from query)
      /category/[categorySlug]/page.tsx (SSR listing by category)
      /[templateId]/page.tsx (SSG detail page)
    /login/page.tsx, /register/page.tsx
    /dashboard/page.tsx (protected)
    /upload/page.tsx (protected)
    /admin/... (optional)
  /lib or /utils (supabase client, auth hooks)
  /styles (global CSS, Tailwind config)
  ```

  Use a top-level `Layout` component (header with nav/search, footer) wrapping pages. Fetch data via `getStaticProps`/`getStaticPaths` (or `generateStaticParams` in app router) for templates and categories.

## Supabase Backend & Data Models

* **Auth:** Supabase Auth for user registration (email/password, OAuth). Use Row-Level Security (RLS) for protected data (e.g. only owner can download private templates).
* **Database Tables (suggested):**

  * `users` (supabase auth table + profile info, role, etc).
  * `templates` (id, title, description, is\_premium, owner\_id, created\_at, updated\_at).
  * `files` (id, template\_id, file\_url, file\_type \[pdf/pptx/googleSlides], etc).
  * `categories` (id, name, slug). *A template can belong to one main category.*
  * `tags` (id, name, slug). *For style, color, subjects, use a many-to-many `template_tags` table.*
  * `favorites` (user\_id, template\_id).
  * `downloads` (user\_id, template\_id, timestamp).
  * `subscriptions` (id, user\_id, plan, status, stripe\_subscription\_id, current\_period\_end).
  * `teams` (id, name) and `team_members` (team\_id, user\_id, role) for multi-seat plans.
  * `payments` (id, user\_id, amount, currency, provider, status, created\_at).
  * `uploads` (if moderation needed: template draft entries).
  * (Optional) `comments` or `reviews`.
* **Relationships:** Templates ⇄ Categories (many-to-one), Templates ⇄ Tags (many-to-many), Users ⇄ Templates (owner), Users ⇄ Favorites/Downloads. Use Supabase’s Postgres and RLS policies to enforce e.g. only owners/editors or admins can modify a template.

## Rendering Strategy (SSR/ISR/CSR)

* **Static/ISR:** Public listing pages and detail pages should use static generation with revalidation. For example, generate each template page at build time or on-demand (ISR) for SEO and speed. Category pages (e.g. `/templates/category/architecture`) can be SSG/ISR. Use a revalidation interval or webhooks (on upload) to update cache. This mirrors Slidesgo/SlideModel which serve template pages statically (they appear as normal HTML pages).
* **Server-Side Rendering:** Use SSR (getServerSideProps or server components) for authenticated routes like `/dashboard`, `/account`, `/upload` where user-specific data is needed (download history, profile, team invites). Also SSR for the homepage if it has personalized content (though it can be largely static with fallback to client updates).
* **Client-Side Rendering:** Interactive components (like filter toggles, “favorite” buttons, or live search suggestions) can be client-side. For example, updating filters without page reload, or a modal editor. Also use CSR for auth state (Supabase hooks) and conditionally showing “Download” vs “Login” buttons. Most browsing and downloading should be pre-rendered/SSR for SEO, but shopping-cart or similar can be CSR.

## Core Components & Routes

* **Layout Components:** Navbar (logo, search box, login status), Footer (links, copyright).
* **Template Components:** `TemplateCard` (image + title + badges), `TemplateGrid`, `TemplateDetail` (gallery of images, description, tags, download buttons).
* **Filter Panel:** Sidebar or top-bar with checkboxes/dropdowns for categories and tags (inspired by Slidesgo’s filters). This could be a component connected to URL query state.
* **Auth Components:** `LoginForm`, `RegisterForm`, and a `RequireAuth` wrapper for protected pages. Possibly use Supabase’s `useUser` hook to access session.
* **Dashboard Components:** Sections for “My Favorites”, “Download History”, and “Subscription Info”. E.g. a `SubscriptionManager` that shows plan status and allows upgrade.
* **Pricing & Subscription:** A page with pricing tiers (using shadcn Cards/Tables) modeled after SlideModel’s plans. A component for selecting a plan and integrating with Stripe.
* **Admin Panel (Optional):** If needed, an admin route (e.g. `/admin/templates`) for adding/editing templates and viewing user stats. Could also be a simple Supabase Studio or a Next.js UI with RLS that only admin role can access.

## UI/UX Recommendations

* **Grid Layout:** Use responsive grid of cards for template listings. Ensure images (thumbnails) are lazy-loaded. Each card shows title, category, and a badge if premium.
* **Filtering Sidebar:** On desktop, show a left sidebar (or dropdown on mobile) with filters like Industry, Style, Format (as in Slidesgo). Allow multi-select and clear filters button. Show active filter chips.
* **Template Page CTAs:** Highlight a prominent “Download” button for free users and a locked “Go Premium” button for premium-only templates. If not logged in, show “Register to download” message. The callouts should be impossible to miss.
* **Search Bar:** Even if heavy JavaScript, include a search input in header. Use instant suggestions or a search results page. Also feature trending tags on homepage (per Slidesgo trending section).
* **Favorites/Wishlist:** Allow users to “favorite” templates (heart icon) for later. This encourages login. Show a list of favorites in the user’s dashboard.
* **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Collapse filters into a top panel or modal on mobile. Use a hamburger menu. Ensure touch-friendly clickable areas. Slidesgo and SlideModel both are responsive.
* **Footer & Help:** Include footer links (About, FAQ, Blog) as Slidesgo does. Provide support/contact access.
* **Visual Style:** Use a clean, professional look (shadcn UI’s default Tailwind design aligns well). Use cards with shadows, clear headings for categories, and iconography for download formats (like Google Slides, PPT, etc.).

## Data Models (Supabase Schema)

```
users
├─ id (UUID, PK)
├─ email, name, avatar_url, created_at, ...
├─ role (enum: “free”, “premium”, “admin”)
subscriptions
├─ id (UUID)
├─ user_id → users.id
├─ plan (text), status (text), stripe_id, current_period_end
templates
├─ id (UUID)
├─ owner_id → users.id (null for official templates)
├─ title, description, thumbnail_url, is_premium (bool), created_at
└─ (other metadata: rating, downloads_count)
files
├─ id (UUID)
├─ template_id → templates.id
├─ file_type (pptx, googleslides, canva), file_url
categories
├─ id, name, slug
template_categories
├─ template_id, category_id
tags (styles/colors/subjects)
├─ id, name, slug, type (e.g. “style” or “color”)
template_tags
├─ template_id, tag_id
favorites
├─ user_id, template_id, added_at
downloads
├─ id, user_id, template_id, timestamp
teams
├─ id, name
team_members
├─ team_id, user_id, role
payments
├─ id, user_id, amount, currency, status, provider, created_at
```

Use Supabase Auth to manage `users`; custom RLS policies secure access (e.g. only `owner_id` or admins can `UPDATE` a template). An uploaded template is added to `templates`, and its files to `files`. Filters query across `categories` and `tags`.

## Rendering Strategy Details

* **Home and Static Pages:** Use Next.js ISR. The homepage and pricing page can be static with periodic revalidation (since content changes infrequently). Trending data (if dynamic) can be fetched client-side or updated via CRON.
* **Template & Category Pages:** Pre-render these at build time or on first request (fallback: true). Configure `getStaticPaths` for templates/categories to handle new content. Revalidate (ISR) when new templates are added. Use Supabase’s incremental static regeneration hooks or a webhook from a CMS.
* **Private/Protected Routes:** Use `getServerSideProps` or middleware for `/dashboard`, `/account`, `/upload`. Protect these with auth guards (redirect to login if no session). Client-side, use `useEffect` with Supabase’s `auth.onAuthStateChange` to handle redirects.
* **Client Interactivity:** Search-as-you-type, filters, and favorites toggling can be implemented with React state or SWR queries to Supabase on-the-fly. For example, applying filters updates the URL and fetches data via an API route or client query.

## Conclusion

By combining the proven patterns from Slidesgo and SlideModel with modern tools, the new platform will offer a familiar UX for template browsing and downloading, while leveraging Next.js for performance and Supabase for a scalable backend. Key elements to adopt are the **category-based navigation with rich filters**, card-grid layouts for templates, gated downloads tied to subscription status, and a clean responsive UI (inspired by these examples). Using SSR/ISR for public content and protected routes for user-specific data will ensure SEO and smooth experience. Supabase’s built-in auth and database solve user/session management, and shadcn UI components provide a polished, consistent frontend. This architecture will support a robust SaaS template marketplace with user accounts, subscription billing, and both public and private template pages, much like the models of Slidesgo, Canva, and SlideModel.
